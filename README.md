ABOUT PROJECT
My project is designed to familiarize with the practical applications of magic methods in Python. 
In this project, I have created custom classes that use magic methods to improve user experience and increase efficiency. 
This class contains properties that allow us to easily implement a variety of behaviors such as mathematical operations, comparisons, and textual representations of objects. 
In this project, almost all magic methods in Python have been discussed.
Using these magical methods, I was able to build a flexible and powerful system that allows for easy expansion and change. 
For example, we were able to define how to compare and sum objects in a custom way, which is very useful in many complex and large systems.

One of the contributing factors that make Python such a powerful programming language is magic methods. 
In some Pythonista circles, you may hear them being referred to as ‘dunder methods’ in light of their double underscores construct. 
Their role in Python is to carry out a procedure known as ‘operator overloading,’ which simply means that a predefined operator is provided with extended meaning. 
In other words, operator overloading is used to add custom behaviors to our classes to enable their usage with Python’s operators and built-in functionality.
